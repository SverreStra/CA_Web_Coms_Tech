  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
  <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise the potential client to always stay up to date on potential threats. I would recomend the client to adopt a cybersecurity framework. I would also recomend removing XSS vulnerabilities like, script, object, embed and link. Have the website ask for a user specific site generated secret. Encourge the client to have a two factor authentication for the site, tell the client to use HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security, to encrypt data sent between client and server. Tell the client to have vulnerability scanning tools so it could do automated security testing and only store and display data that are needed for the website to run. for example just show the last 4 digits of the credit card. For the last thing I would recommend is to have an automatic user timeout, so if the user forgets to log out, it logs out automaticly after a while. </p>
